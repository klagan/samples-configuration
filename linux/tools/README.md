# Getting started

Edit the variables and run the `client-mapshare.sh` script.  

This script stores pre-requisites, custom and sensitive information.  **Be careful not to save this into a code repository**.  It is safer to copy this file and the `map-drive.sh` onto a local folder on the server to edit and run.
